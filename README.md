### Hi there 👋


**Ashastry2/Ashastry2** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on snakemake pipelines
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create documentation using sphinx
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with horizontal scrolling in CSS containers
- 💬 Ask me about "How to create pretty plots"
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
